            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Global Warming's Terrifying New Chemistry</h1><p>* To understand how we got here, it's necessary to remember what a savior fracked natural gas looked like to many people, environmentalists included. As George W. Bush took hold of power in Washington, coal was ascendant, here and around the globe.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/14c17433999cab916f24cdd50892db7c3b5b1453.jpg"></article>]]></description>

The future is a quickly-changing concept, now filled with gesture recognition and voice-only interfaces, and it surely doesn't look the same as it did when the first mouse was brought to market in 1981.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/7e090bf34f3e578fbbc4ad286f9141517587dcd3.jpg"></article>]]></description>

Hi, I'm Helen Situ and for the past 2 years I've dedicated my life to virtual reality.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Wireless tech means safer drones, smarter homes and password-free WiFi</h1><p>We've all been there, impatiently twiddling our thumbs while trying to locate a WiFi signal. But what if, instead, the WiFi could locate us? According to researchers at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), it could mean safer drones, smarter homes, and password-free WiFi.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/28cb1f73a56862adee852a936e0b0e9956f828a2.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>New Camera Tech Snaps Reflection-Free Photos Through Windows</h1><p>Taking photos through windows is annoying because light bounces off it and ruins the picture. But scientists at MIT just developed new technology that could fix the pesky reflections. Members of MIT's Media Lab have developed tech that detects how long it takes flash to bounce back off nearby objects (like, say, a window) and objects that are farther away (your subject).</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c278f317c4da251701afbf691f3278694980c4b5.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>First USB-Powered 8TB Drive Is as Portable as a Flash Drive</h1><p>Keeping the number of power cords dangling off your desk to a minimum usually means settling for a smaller capacity backup drive that draws all the power it needs from a single USB cable. But Seagate's new Innov8 drive packs 8TB of storage into an external closure that doesn't need to draw power from an outlet.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/80670a670e021eb22af54cac0a4635c4082b4bc9.jpg"></article>]]></description>

It doesn't look like a place to make groundbreaking discoveries that change the trajectory of society. But in these simulated, claustrophobic corridors, Demis Hassabis thinks he can lay the foundations for software that's smart enough to solve humanity's biggest problems. "Our goal's very big," says Hassabis, whose level-headed manner can mask the audacity of his ideas.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/9ea48fac33f46c8a3940dd4b0f73280407a22d95.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Where Is the iPod of Smartwatches?</h1><p>The lifecycle of a new gadget is relatively predictable: When it's brand new, only early adopters are interested. Once the technology matures, everybody buys one. But smartwatches still haven't caught on with most people-and that's because no one has made a smartwatch that's worth its cost.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/897a8e00a9654b46e028eebde098b1e6f5179a3f.jpg"></article>]]></description>
